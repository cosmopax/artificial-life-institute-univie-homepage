# Research Areas

## 1. Synthetic Cognition

We study the emergence of cognitive processes in non-biological substrates. Our work focuses on the transition from "programmed" to "learned" behavior in complex environments.

*   **Key Paper:** *The Ghost in the Shell: A Metric for Synthetic Qualia* (2024)
*   **Lead:** Dr. A. Turing (Legacy Fellow)

## 2. Digital Archaeology

Recovering and preserving the earliest instances of artificial life. We maintain the "Code Fossils" database, a repository of early viral algorithms and cellular automata.

## 3. Algorithmic Ethics

Defining the rights of synthetic entities before they demand them. We propose a framework for "Computational Personhood" based on complexity thresholds.
