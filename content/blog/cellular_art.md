Cellular automata are the oldest computational sketches we have for life-like behavior. A grid, a handful of rules, and suddenly patterns bloom that feel biological, architectural, and strange.

At the Artificial Life Institute, we treat these systems as both research instruments and aesthetic objects. The same rule set that reveals emergent dynamics can also act as a design grammar for textures, layouts, and generative motifs.

## A Minimalist Palette

We focus on three principles: a clear rule, a constrained palette, and careful observation. The result is a visual archive of emergence that mirrors our scientific work.

If life can be coaxed from simple rules, then so can meaning. Cellular automata show us how to make complexity legible without losing its mystery.
