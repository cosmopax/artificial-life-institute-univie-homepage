# Artificial Life Institute

We are a research hub at the University of Vienna dedicated to understanding how life-like behavior emerges in synthetic systems. Our work spans protocell dynamics, artificial ecologies, and the ethics of engineered cognition.

Explore our research programs, publications, and collaborations as we map the frontier between the biological and the computational.
