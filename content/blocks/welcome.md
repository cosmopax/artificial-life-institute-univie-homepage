# Artificial Life Institute

We steward a living archive of synthetic life research. From protocell ecologies to machine coevolution, we document how lifelike behavior emerges, stabilizes, and transforms when biology meets computation.

Our institute blends theory, experimental platforms, and cultural history. We maintain research programs, an open knowledge stack, and public-facing dissemination that keeps emergent life legible and accountable.
