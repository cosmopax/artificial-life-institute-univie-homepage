# Methods and Facilities

Our infrastructure blends simulation, fabrication, and open research platforms to document artificial life across media.

- **Simulation Stack:** agent-based models, evolutionary computation, and parameter sweeps.
- **Wet Lab Interfaces:** protocell environments and bio-hybrid experiments.
- **Open Repositories:** datasets, code, and archival artifacts for public study.
- **Field Notes Studio:** editorial lab for documentation and public interpretation.
