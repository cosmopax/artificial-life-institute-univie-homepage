# Methods and Facilities

Our infrastructure blends simulation, fabrication, and open research platforms to document artificial life across media.

- **Genome-Scale Modeling (GEMs):** AI-driven predictive modeling for non-model fungal hosts.
- **CRISPR-Cas12a Systems:** Multiplex editing for simultaneous deletion of competitive pathways and integration of heterologous gene clusters.
- **Simulation Stack:** Agent-based models, evolutionary computation, and parameter sweeps.
- **Wet Lab Interfaces:** Protocell environments and bio-hybrid experiments.
- **Open Repositories:** Datasets, code, and archival artifacts for public study.
- **Field Notes Studio:** Editorial lab for documentation and public interpretation.
