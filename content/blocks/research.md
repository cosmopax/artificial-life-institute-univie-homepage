# Research

Our research focuses on the emergence of life-like behavior in computational and hybrid systems. We track phenomena across timescales, from microdynamics to ecosystem-level coordination.

- **Synthetic Cognition:** learning, adaptation, and memory in artificial agents.
- **Digital Evolution:** evolutionary dynamics in silico with open-ended novelty.
- **Bio-Inspired Systems:** protocells, swarms, and minimal life architectures.
- **Ecological Interfaces:** feedback between computation, materials, and environments.
