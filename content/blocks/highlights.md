# Archive Highlights

Our archive curates traces of artificial life as it emerges. Each dossier captures the system, its milieu, and the conditions that made it possible.

- **Dossier: Proto-Assemblies** - early protocell experiments and hybrid substrates.
- **Dossier: Algorithmic Ecologies** - long-horizon simulations and coevolution.
- **Dossier: Synthetic Memory** - architectures for retention, transfer, and inheritance.
- **Dossier: Ethics of Emergence** - governance models for novel synthetic actors.
