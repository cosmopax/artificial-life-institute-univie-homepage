# Research Programs

We organize our research through programs that combine theory, computation, and experimental systems. Each program operates as a semi-autonomous lab with shared tooling.

- **Emergent Cognition:** sense-making, adaptation, and embodied computation.
- **Synthetic Ecologies:** multi-agent ecosystems, resilience, and metabolic exchange.
- **Material Computation:** wetware, protocells, and bio-hybrid systems.
- **Governance and Ethics:** accountability frameworks for emergent agents.
