# Team

Our institute brings together researchers in artificial life, evolutionary dynamics, and computational creativity. The core team spans theoretical work, experimental systems, and public-facing scholarship.

- **Directors and Fellows:** vision, program strategy, and cross-lab collaboration.
- **Research Cells:** small teams on protocells, synthetic ecologies, and evolutionary computation.
- **Visiting Scholars:** short residencies for adjacent fields and experimental practice.
- **Public Interface:** exhibitions, publications, and translation into civic dialogue.

We are updating the full roster. If you are seeking a collaboration or affiliation, please reach out through the contact page.
