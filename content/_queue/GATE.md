# Publishing Gate Checklist

Before moving content from `review/` to `published/` (and subsequently to `blocks/` or `pages.csv`), verify:

- [ ] **Links Verified**: All internal and external links are reachable.
- [ ] **No Secrets**: No API keys, tokens, or private emails in the content.
- [ ] **Conservative Claims**: All research claims are cited or stated with appropriate uncertainty ("suggests", "may indicate").
- [ ] **Images Optimized**: Images are compressed (WebP preferred) and reside in `assets/` or `media/`.
- [ ] **Hygiene**: No placeholder text or "lorem ipsum".
