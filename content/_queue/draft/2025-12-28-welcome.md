We are excited to announce the launch of the Artificial Life Institute's new digital home at the University of Vienna.

Our institute is dedicated to investigating lifelike dynamics, synthetic ecologies, and the fundamental principles that allow complex systems to adapt and persist. By connecting computation, biology, robotics, and philosophy, we aim to build bridges between disciplines and cultivate a rigorous, creative research culture.

In this blog, we will share updates on:
- **Research Highlights**: Deep dives into our core themes like open-ended evolution and morphogenesis.
- **Events**: Upcoming seminars, workshops, and public lectures.
- **Opportunities**: Calls for collaboration, student projects, and visiting scholar positions.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to explore the origins of life and the future of synthetic systems.
