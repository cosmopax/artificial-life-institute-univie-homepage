# Coding Standards

- **Python**: Python 3.9+. Use standard library `pathlib` for file ops.
- **Style**: PEP 8 where reasonable.
- **Architecture**: Keep the build script simple. Do not introduce complex template engines unless necessary.
- **HTML/CSS**: Use semantic HTML. Inline CSS in `build.py` is currently accepted for simplicity, though extraction is planned.
- **Content**: No "blind deletions". Conservative claims only.
