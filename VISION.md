# Vision

To create a professional, research-focused digital presence for the Artificial Life Institute at the University of Vienna. The site serves as a hub for "lifelike dynamics, synthetic ecologies, and adaptive systems," reflecting the institute's interdisciplinary nature across computation, biology, and philosophy. It must be robust, strictly static (no server-side dynamic code), and highly performant.
